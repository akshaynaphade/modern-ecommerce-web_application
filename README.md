Prerequisites
Node.js (v16 or higher)

npm or yarn

MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based like MongoDB Atlas)

Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

1. Clone the repository

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
2. Setup the Backend

Bash

# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file in the /backend directory
# Copy the contents from .env.example or use the template below
touch .env
Your backend/.env file should look like this:

MONGO_URI=your_mongo_db_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=a_very_strong_and_long_secret_key
PORT=5000
3. (Optional) Seed the Database

To populate the database with initial sample data, run the seed script.

Bash

# Make sure your backend server is NOT running
node seed.js
4. Run the Backend Server

Bash

npm start
The backend API will be running on http://localhost:5000.

5. Setup the Frontend

Bash

# Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the React development server
npm start
The frontend application will be available at http://localhost:3000.
